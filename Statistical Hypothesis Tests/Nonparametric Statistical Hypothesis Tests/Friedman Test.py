'''
Tests whether the distributions of two or more paired samples are equal or not.

Assumptions

    Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
    Observations in each sample can be ranked.
    Observations across each sample are paired.

Interpretation

    H0: the distributions of all samples are equal.
    H1: the distributions of one or more samples are not equal.

# Example of the Friedman Test

data2 = [1.142, -0.432, -0.938, -0.729, -0.846, -0.157, 0.500, 1.183, -1.075, -0.169]
data3 = [-0.208, 0.696, 0.928, -1.148, -0.213, 0.229, 0.137, 0.269, -0.870, -1.204]

if p > 0.05:
	print('Probably the same distribution')
else:
	print('Probably different distributions')
