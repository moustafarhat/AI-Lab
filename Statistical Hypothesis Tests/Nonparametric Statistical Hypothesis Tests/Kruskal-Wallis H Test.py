'''
Tests whether the distributions of two or more independent samples are equal or not.

Assumptions

    Observations in each sample are independent and identically distributed (iid).
    Observations in each sample can be ranked.

Interpretation

    H0: the distributions of all samples are equal.
    H1: the distributions of one or more samples are not equal.
